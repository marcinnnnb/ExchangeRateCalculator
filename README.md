# ExchangeRateCalculator

Based on course '20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript' created by Brad Traversy (https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/), I would like to present a project 4/20: Exchange Rate Calculator.

Fetch exchange rates from API (https://api.exchangerate-api.com)
